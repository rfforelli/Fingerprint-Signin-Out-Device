# Fingerprint-Signin-Out-Device-Code

This is the code used to operate my fingerprint signin/out device I built for the Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science (PJAS) competition. I used an ESP-32S for the device alon with a fingerprint scanner, a 20 button keypad, an LCD. I initially used an Arduino Uno with a real time clock module and an SD card reader, but switched to an ESP-32S to upload the signin/out logs of a school classroom to a Google Sheets along with the time sign out, destination, date, name, and time signed back in.
